**Machine Learning Projects**

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have worked on using python. Each project is organized into its own folder and includes its own README file with specific details about that project, the data ie, csv and the model using ML.


**Diabetes**: This machine learning project aims to predict the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels in individuals to determine if they have no diabetes, pre-diabetes, or diabetes. By analyzing various factors such as obesity, waist/hip ratio, hypertension, and other cardiovascular risk factors, the project seeks to develop a model that can accurately classify individuals based on their A1C levels and provide insights for diabetes prevention and management.

**Life Expectancy**:This machine learning project aims to analyze various factors affecting life expectancy across 193 countries from 2000 to 2015. By considering immunization, mortality, economic, and social factors, the project seeks to identify the key predictors influencing life expectancy and provide insights for improving population health.

**Insurance**: This machine learning project aims to predict insurance costs based on demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and residential region in the US.
