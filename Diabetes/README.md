# Machine Learning Project: Predicting A1C Levels for Diabetes Classification

This machine learning project aims to predict the A1C levels in individuals to classify them into three categories: no-diabetes, pre-diabetes, and diabetes. The dataset used for this project is courtesy of Dr. John Schorling from the Department of Medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 19 variables collected from 403 subjects who were part of a study conducted in central Virginia for African Americans. The study aimed to understand the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors. The variables include information such as age, sex, BMI (Body Mass Index), waist/hip ratio, presence of hypertension, and other relevant factors associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the A1C levels for individuals. By analyzing various factors related to obesity, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, the model will classify individuals into one of three categories: no-diabetes, pre-diabetes, or diabetes.

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and preprocess the dataset for further analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between variables.
3. Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features that strongly correlate with A1C levels and contribute to diabetes classification.
4. Model Development: Build and train machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines to predict A1C levels.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Model Optimization: Fine-tune the models by optimizing hyperparameters, using techniques like cross-validation or grid search, to improve their performance.
7. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data and classify individuals into the appropriate diabetes category.

## Conclusion

By accurately predicting A1C levels, this machine learning project aims to aid in the early detection and classification of diabetes, which can help in implementing timely interventions and lifestyle modifications. The developed model can provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals to better manage and prevent diabetes-related complications.
